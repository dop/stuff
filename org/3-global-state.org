Accessing global state statically doesn't clarify those shared
dependencies to readers of the constructors and methods that use the
Global State. Global State and Singletons make APIs lie about their true
dependencies. To really understand the dependencies, developers must
read every line of code. It causes Spooky Action at a Distance: when
running test suites, global state mutated in one test can cause a
subsequent or parallel test to fail unexpectedly. Break the static
dependency using manual or Guice dependency injection.

*NOTE:* /When we say "Singleton" or "JVM Singleton" in this document, we
mean the classic Gang of Four singleton. (We say that this singleton
enforces its own "singletonness" though a static instance field). An
"application singleton" on the other hand is an object which has a
single instance in our application, but which does/ not /enforce its own
"singletonness."/

** Global State Dirties your Design
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: global-state-dirties-your-design
     :END:

The root problem with global state is that it is globally accessible. In
an ideal world, an object should be able to interact only with other
objects which were directly passed into it (through a constructor, or
method call).

In other words, if I instantiate two objects A and B, and I never pass a
reference from A to B, then neither A nor B can get hold of the other or
modify the other's state. This is a very desirable property of code. /If
I don't tell you about something, then it is not yours to interact
with!/ Notice how this not the case with global variables or with
Singletons. Object A could --- unknown to developers --- get hold of
singleton C and modify it. If, when object B gets instantiated, it too
grabs singleton C, then A and B can affect each other through C. (Or
interactions can overlap through C).

"The problem with using a Singleton is that it introduces a certain
amount of coupling into a system --- coupling that is almost always
unnecessary. You are saying that your class can only collaborate with
one particular implementation of a set of methods --- the implementation
that the Singleton provides. You will allow no substitutes. This makes
it difficult to test your class in isolation from the Singleton. The
very nature of test isolation assumes the ability to substitute
alternative implementations... for an object's collaborators. ...
[U]nless you change your design, you are forced to rely on the correct
behavior of the Singleton in order to test any of its clients." [J.B.
Rainsberger, Junit Recipes, Recipe 14.4]

** Global State enables Spooky Action at a Distance
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: global-state-enables-spooky-action-at-a-distance
     :END:

Spooky Action at a Distance is when we run one thing that we believe is
isolated (since we did not pass any references in) but unexpected
interactions and state changes happen in distant locations of the system
which we did not tell the object about. This can only happen via global
state. For instance, let's pretend we call printPayrollReport(Employee
employee). This method lives in a class that has two fields: Printer and
PayrollDatabase.

Very sinister Spooky Action at a Distance would become possible if this
also initiated direct deposit at the bank, via a global method:
BankAccount.payEmployee(Employee employee, Money amount). Your code
authors would never do that ... or would they?

How about this for a less sinister example. What if printPayrollReport
also sent a notification out to PrinterSupplyVendor.notifyTonerUsed(int
pages, double perPageCoverage)? This may seem like a convenience ---
when you print the payroll report, also notify the supplies vendor how
much toner you used, so that you'll automatically get a refill before
you run out. It is not a convenience. It is bad design and, like all
statics, it makes your code base harder to understand, evolve, test, and
refactor.

You may not have thought of it this way before, but whenever you use
static state, you're creating secret communication channels and not
making them clear in the API. Spooky Action at a Distance forces
developers to read every line of code to understand the potential
interactions, lowers developer productivity, and confuses new team
members.

Do not approve code that uses statics and allows for a Spooky code base.
Favor dependency injection of the specific collaborators needed (a
PrinterSupplyVendor instance in the example above ... perhaps scoped as
a Guice singleton if there's only one in the application).

** Global State & Singletons makes for Brittle Applications (and Tests)
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: global-state-singletons-makes-for-brittle-applications-and-tests
     :END:

- Static access prevents collaborating with a subclass or wrapped
  version of another class. By hard-coding the dependency, we lose the
  power and flexibility of polymorphism.
- Every test using global state needs it to start in an expected state,
  or the test will fail. But another object might have mutated that
  global state in a previous test.
- Global state often prevents tests from being able to run in parallel,
  which forces test suites to run slower.
- If you add a new test (which doesn't clean up global state) and it
  runs in the middle of the suite, another test may fail that runs after
  it.
- Singletons enforcing their own "Singletonness" end up cheating.

  - You'll often see mutator methods such as reset() or setForTest(...)
    on so-called singletons, because you'll need to change the instance
    during tests. If you forget to reset the Singleton after a test, a
    later use will use the stale underlying instance and may fail in a
    way that's difficult to debug.

** Global State & Singletons turn APIs into Liars
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: global-state-singletons-turn-apis-into-liars
     :END:

Let us look at a test we want to write:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    testActionAtADistance() {
          CreditCard = new CreditCard("4444444444444441", "01/11");
          assertTrue(card.charge(100));
          // but this test fails at runtime!
          }
#+END_EXAMPLE

Charging a credit card takes more then just modifying the internal state
of the credit card object. It requires that we talk to external systems.
We need to know the URL, we need to authenticate, we need to store a
record in the database. But none of this is made clear when we look at
how CreditCard is used. We say that the CreditCard API is lying. Let's
try again:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    testActionAtADistanceWithInitializtion() {
          // Global state needs to get set up first
          Database.init("dbURL", "user", "password");
          CreditCardProcessor.init("http://processorurl", "security key", "vendor");

          CreditCard = new CreditCard("4444444444444441", "01/11");
          assertTrue(card.charge(100));

          // but this test still fails!
          }
#+END_EXAMPLE

By looking at the API of CreditCard, there is no way to know the global
state you have to initialize. Even looking at the source code of
CreditCard will not tell you which initialization method to call. At
best, you can find the global variable being accessed and from there try
to guess how to initialize it.

Here is how you fix the global state. Notice how it is much clearer
initializing the dependencies of CreditCard.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    testUsingDependencyInjectedObjects() {
          Database db = new Database("dbURL", "user", "password");
          CreditCardProcessor processor = new CreditCardProcessor(db, "http://processorurl", "security key", "vendor");
          CreditCard = new CreditCard(processor, "4444444444444441", "01/11");
          assertTrue(card.charge(100));
          }
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Each object that you needed to create declared its dependencies in
the API of its constructor. It is no longer ambiguous how to build the
objects you need in order to test CreditCard.
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: each-object-that-you-needed-to-create-declared-its-dependencies-in-the-api-of-its-constructor.-it-is-no-longer-ambiguous-how-to-build-the-objects-you-need-in-order-to-test-creditcard.
     :END:

By declaring the dependency explicitly, it is clear which objects need
to be instantiated (in this case that the CreditCard needs a
CreditCardProcessor which in turn needs Database).

** Globality and "Global Load" is Transitive
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: globality-and-global-load-is-transitive
     :END:

We can define /"global load"/ as how many variables are exposed for
(direct or indirect) mutation through global state. The higher the
number, the bigger the problem. Below, we have a global load of one.

#+BEGIN_SRC java
class UniqueID {
 // Global Load of 1 because only nextID is exposed as global state
 private *static* int nextID = 0;
 int static get() {
 return nextID++;
 }
}
#+END_SRC

What would the global load be in the example below?

#+BEGIN_SRC java
class AppSettings {
 static AppSettings instance = new AppSettings();
 int numberOfThreads = 10;
 int maxLatency = 20;

 int timeout = 30;

 private AppSettings(){} // To prevent people from instantiating

}
#+END_SRC

Here the problem is a bit more complicated. The instance field is
declared as static final. By traversing the global instance we expose
three variables: numberOfThreads, maxLatency, and timeout. Once we
access a global variable, all variables accessed through it become
global as well. The global load is 3.

From a behavior point of view, there is no difference between a global
variable declared directly through a static and a variable made global
transitively. They are equally damaging. An application can have only
very few static variables and yet transitively accumulate a high global
load.

** A Singleton is Global State in Sheep's Clothing
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: a-singleton-is-global-state-in-sheeps-clothing
     :END:

Most software engineers will agree that Global State is undesirable.
However, a Singleton creates Global State, yet so many people still use
that in new code. Fight the trend and encourage people to use other
mechanisms instead of a classical JVM Singleton.¬† Often we don't really
need singletons (object creation is pretty cheap these days). If you
need to guarantee one shared instance per application, use Guice's
Singleton Scope.

** "But My Application Only has One Singleton" is Meaningless
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: but-my-application-only-has-one-singleton-is-meaningless
     :END:

Here is a typical singleton implementation of Cache.

#+BEGIN_SRC java
class Cache {
 static final instance Cache = new Cache();

 Map<String, User> userCache = new HashMap<String, User>();
 EvictionStrategy eviction = new LruEvictionStrategy();

 private Cache(){} // private constructor //..
}
#+END_SRC

This singleton has an unboundedly high level of Global Load. (We can
place an unlimited number of users in userCache). The Cache singleton
exposes the Map<String, User> into global state, and thus exposes every
user as globally visible. In addition, the internal state of each User,
and the EvictionStrategy is also exposed as globally mutable. As we can
see it is very easy for an innocent object to become entangled with
global state. *Statements like "But my application only has one
singleton" are meaningless, because /total exposed global state/ is the
transitive closure of the objects accessible from explicit global
state.*

** Global State in /Application/ /Runtime/ May Deceptively "Feel Okay"
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: global-state-in-application-runtime-may-deceptively-feel-okay
     :END:

At production we instantiate one instance of an application, hence
global state is not a problem from a state collision point of view.
(There is still a problem of dirtying your design --- see above). It is
uncommon to instantiate two copies of the same application in a single
JVM, so it may "feel okay" to have global state in production. (One
exception is a web server. It is common to have multiple instances of a
web server running on different ports. Global state could be problematic
there.) As we will soon see this "ok feeling" is misleading, and it
actually is an Insidious Beast.

** Global State in /Test Runtime/ is an Insidious Beast
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: global-state-in-test-runtime-is-an-insidious-beast
     :END:

At test time, each test is an isolated partial instantiation of an
application. No external state enters the test (there is no external
object passed into the tests constructor or test method). And no state
leaves the tests (the test methods are void, returning nothing). When an
ideal test completes, all state related to that test disappears. This
makes tests isolated and all of the objects it created are subject to
garbage collection. In addition the state created is confined to the
current thread. This means we can run tests in parallel or in any order.
However, when global state/singletons are present all of these nice
assumptions break down. State can enter and leave the test and it is not
garbage collected. This makes the order of tests matter. You cannot run
the tests in parallel and your tests can become flaky due to thread
interactions.

True singletons are most likely impossible to test. As a result most
developers who try to test applications with singletons often relax the
singleton property of their singletons into two ways. (1) They remove
the final keyword from the static final declaration of the instance.
This allows them to substitute different singletons for different tests.
(2) they provide a second initalizeForTest() method which allows them to
modify the singleton state. However, these solutions at best are a
/hack/ which produce hard to maintain and understand code. Every test
(or tearDown) affecting any global state must undo those changes, or
leak them to subsequent tests. And test isolation is nearly impossible
if running tests in parallel.

Global state is the single biggest headache of unit testing!

* Recognizing the Flaw
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: recognizing-the-flaw
    :END:

- Symptom: Presence of static fields
- Symptom: Code in the CL makes static method calls
- Symptom: A Singleton has initializeForTest(...), uninitialize(...),
  and other resetting methods (i.e. to tell it to use some light weight
  service instead of one that talks to other servers).
- Symptom: Tests fail when run in a suite, but pass individually or vice
  versa
- Symptom: Tests fail if you change the order of execution
- Symptom: Flag values are read or written to, or
  Flags.disableStateCheckingForTest() and
  Flags.enableStateCheckingForTest() is called.
- Symptom: Code in the CL has or uses Singletons, Mingletons,
  Hingletons, and Fingletons (see [[http://code.google.com/p/google-singleton-detector/wiki/WhySingletonsAreControversial][Google Singleton Detector]].)

*There is a distinction between global as in "JVM Global State" and
global as in "Application Shared State."*

- JVM Global State occurs when the static keyword is used to make
  accessible a field or a method that returns a shared object. The use
  of static in order to facilitate shared state is the problem. Because
  static is enforced as One Per JVM, parallelizing and isolating tests
  becomes a huge problem. From a maintenance point of view, static
  fields create coupling, hidden colaborators and APIs which lie about
  their true dependencies. /Static access is the root of the problem./
- Application Shared State simply means the same instance is shared in
  multiple places throughout the code. There may or may not be multiple
  instances of a class instantiated at any one time, depending on
  whether application logic enforces uniqueness. The shared state is not
  accessed globally through the use of static. It is passed to
  collaborators who need the state, or Guice manages the consistent
  injection of needed shared state (i.e. During a request the same User
  needs to be injected into multiple objects within the thread that is
  servicing that user's request. Guice would scope that as
  @RequestScoped.) It is not shared state in and of itself that is a
  problem. There are places in an application that need access to shared
  state. It's sharing that state through /statics/ that causes brittle
  code and difficulty for testing.

/Test for JVM Global State:/\\
Answer the following question: "Can I, in theory, create a second
instance of your application in the same JVM, and not have any
collisions?" If you can't, then you're using JVM Global State (using the
static keyword, you're having the JVM enforce a singleton's
singletoness). Use Dependency Injection with Guice instead for shared
state.

* Fixing the Flaw
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: fixing-the-flaw
    :END:

Dependency Injection is your Friend.\\
Dependency Injection is your Friend.\\
Dependency Injection is your Friend.

- If you need a collaborator, use Dependency Injection (pass in the
  collaborator to the constructor). Dependency injection will make your
  collaborators clear, and give you seams for injecting test-doubles.
- If you need shared state, use Guice which can manage Application Scope
  singletons in a way that is still entirely testable.
- If a static is used widely in the codebase, and you cannot replace it
  with a Guice Singleton Scoped object in one CL, try one of these
  workaround:

  - Create an Adapter class. It will probably have just a default
    constructor, and methods of the Adapter will each be named the same
    as (and call through to) a static method you're trying to decouple
    from. This doesn't fully fix the problems--the static access still
    exists, but at least the Adapter can be faked/mocked in testing.
    Once all consumers of a static method or utility filled with static
    methods have been adapted, the statics can be eliminated by pushing
    the shared behavior/state into the Adapters (turning them from
    adapters into full fledged collaborators). Use application logic or
    Guice scopes to enforce necessary sharing.
  - Rather than wrapping an adapter around the static methods, you can
    sometimes move the shared behavior/state into an instantiable class
    early. Have Guice manage the instantiable object (perhaps in
    @Singleton scope) and place a Guice-managed instance behind the
    static method, until all callers can be refactored to inject the
    instance instead of using it through the static method. Again, this
    is a half-solution that still retains statics, but it's a step
    toward removing the statics that may be useful when dealing with
    pervasive static methods.
  - When eliminating a Singleton in small steps, try binding a Guice
    Provider to the class you want to share in Scopes.Singleton (or use
    a provider method annotated @Singleton). The Provider returns an
    instance it retrieves from the GoF Singleton. Use Guice to inject
    the shared instance where possible, and once all sites can be
    injected, eliminate the GoF Singleton.

- If you're stuck with a library class' static methods, wrap it in an
  object that implements an interface. Pass in the object where it is
  needed. You can stub the interface for testing, and cut out the static
  dependency. See the example below.
- If using Guice, you can use
  GUICE[[https://www.corp.google.com/%7Eengdocs/nonconf/java/common/com/google/common/inject/FlagBinder.html][]]
  to bind flag values to injectable objects. Then wherever you need the
  flag's value, inject it. For tests, you can pass in any value with
  dependency injection, bypassing the flag entirely and enabling easy
  parallelization.

For various reasons, it may be necessary to have only one of something
in your application. Typically this is implemented as a Singleton [GoF],
in which the class can give out one instance of an object, and it is
impossible to instantiate two instances at the same time. There is a
price to pay for such a JVM Singleton, and that price is flexibility and
testability.People may work around these problems (by breaking
encapsulation) with setForTest(...) and resetForTest() methods to alter
the underlying singleton's instance.

- Flaw: As in all uses of static methods, there are no seams to
  polymorphically change the implementation. Your code becomes more
  fragile and brittle.
- Flaw: Tests cannot run in parallel, as each thread's mutations to
  shared global state will collide.
- Flaw: @VisibleForTesting is a hint that the class should be re-worked
  so that it does not need to break encapsulation in order to be tested.
  Notice how that is removed in the solution.

If you need a guarantee of "just one instance" in your application, tell
Guice that object is in Singleton scope. Guice managed singletons are
not a design problem, because in your tests you can create multiple
instances (to run in parallel, preventing interactions, and under
different configurations). During production runtime, Guice will ensure
that the same instance is injected.

state). Like all global state, though, they come with a heavy cost.
Flags have a serious flaw. Because they share global state, they need to
be very carefully adjusted before and after tests. (Otherwise subsequent
tests might fail).

- Flaw: One test can set a flag value and then forget to reset it,
  causing subsequent tests to fail.
- Flaw: If two tests need different values of a certain flag to run, you
  cannot parallelize them. If you tried to, there would be a race
  condition on which thread sets the flags value, and the other thread's
  tests would fail.
- Flaw: The code that needs flags is brittle, and consumers of it don't
  know by looking at the API if flags are used or not. The API is lying
  to you.

To remedy these problems, turn to our friend Dependency Injection. You
can use Guice to discover and make injectable all flags in any given
classes. Then you can automatically inject the flag /values/ that are
needed, without ever referencing the static flag variables. Because
you're working with regular java objects (not Flags) there is no longer
a need to call Flags.disableStateCheckingForTest() or
Flags.enableStateCheckingForTest().

Tests for classes exhibiting this problem may pass individually, but
fail when run in a suite. They also might fail if the test ordering
changes in the suite.

Depending on the order of execution for tests, whichever first causes
RpcClient to load will cause FLAG_useRealBackend to be read, and the
value permanently set. Future tests that may want to use a different
backend can't, because statics enable global state to persist between
setup and teardowns of tests.

If you work around this by exposing a setter for the RpcClient‚Äòs
Backend, you'll have the same problem as /"Problem: Need to call
setForTest(...) and/or resetForTest() Methods,"/ above. The underlying
problem with statics won't be solved.

- Flaw: Static Initialization Blocks are run once, and are
  non-overridable by tests
- Flaw: The Backend is set once, and never can be altered for future
  tests. This may cause some tests to fail, depending on the ordering of
  the tests.

To remedy these problems, first remove the static state. Then inject
into the RpcClient the Backend that it needs. Dependency Injection to
the rescue. Again. Use Guice to manage the single instance of the
RpcClient in the application's scope. Getting away from a JVM Singleton
makes testing all around easier.

Sometimes you will be stuck with a static method in a library that you
need to prevent from running in a test. But you need the library so you
can't remove or replace it with a non-static implementation. Because it
is a library, you don't have the control to remove the static modifier
and make it an instance method.

- Flaw: You are forced to execute the TrackStatusChecker‚Äòs method even
  when you don't want to, because it is locked in there with a static
  call.
- Flaw: Tests may be slower, and risk mutating global state through the
  static in the library.
- Flaw: Static methods are non-overridable and non-injectable.
- Flaw: Static methods remove a seam from your test code.

If you control the code (it is not a third party library), you want to
fix the root problem and remove the static method.

If you can't change the external library, wrap it in a class that
implements the same interface (or create your own interface). You can
then inject a test-double for the wrapped library that has different
test-specific behavior. This is a better design, as well as more easily
testable. Often we find that testable code is higher quality, more
easily maintained, and more productive-to-work-in code. Consider also
that if you create your own interface, you may not need to support every
method in a library class--just adapt the functionality you actually
use.

* Caveat: When is Global State OK?
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: caveat-when-is-global-state-ok
    :END:

There are two cases when global state is tolerable.

(1) When the /reference is a constant/ and the object it points to is
either /primitive or immutable/. So static final String URL =
"http://google.com"; is OK since there is no way to mutate the value.
Remember, the transitive closure of all objects you are pointing to must
be immutable as well since globality is transitive. The String is safe,
but replace it with a MyObject, and it gets be risky due to the
transitive closure of all state MyObject exposes. You are on thin ice if
someone in the future decides to add mutable state to your immutable
object and then your innocent code changes into a headache.

(2) When the /information only travels one way/. For example a Logger is
one big singleton. However our application only writes to logger and
never reads from it. More importantly our application does not behave
differently based on what is or is not enabled in our logger. While it
is not a problem from test point of view, it is a problem if you want to
assert that your application does indeed log important messages. This is
because there is no way for the test to replace the Logger with a
test-double (I know we can set our own handler for log level, but those
are just more of the problems shown above). If you want to test the
logger then change the class to dependency inject in the Logger so that
you can insert a MockLogger and assert that the correct things were
written to the Logger. (As a convenience, Guice automatically knows how
to Constructor Inject a configured logger for any class, just add it to
the constructor's params and the right one will be passed in.)
