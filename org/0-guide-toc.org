To keep our code at Google in the best possible shape we provided our
software engineers with these constant reminders. Now, we are happy to
share them with the world.

Many thanks to these folks for inspiration and hours of hard work
getting this guide done:

Also thanks to Blaine R Southam who has turned it into a [[http://misko.hevery.com/attachments/Guide-Writing%20Testable%20Code.pdf][pdf book]].

* [[file:1-constructor-does-real-work.org][Flaw #1: Constructor does Real Work]]

*Warning Signs*

- =new= keyword in a constructor or at field declaration
- Static method calls in a constructor or at field declaration
- Anything more than field assignment in constructors
- Object not fully initialized after the constructor finishes (watch out
  for initialize methods)
- Control flow (conditional or looping logic) in a constructor
- Code does complex object graph construction inside a constructor
  rather than using a factory or builder
- Adding or using an initialization block

* [[file:2-digging-into-collaborators.org][Flaw #2: Digging into Collaborators]]

*Warning Signs*

- Objects are passed in but never used directly (only used to get access
  to other objects)
- Law of Demeter violation: method call chain walks an object graph with
  more than one dot (.)
- Suspicious names: context, environment, principal, container, or
  manager

* [[file:3-global-state.org][Flaw #3: Brittle Global State & Singletons]]

*Warning Signs*

- Adding or using singletons
- Adding or using static fields or static methods
- Adding or using static initialization blocks
- Adding or using registries
- Adding or using service locators

* [[file:4-doing-too-much.org][Flaw #4: Class Does Too Much]]

*Warning Signs*

- Summing up what the class does includes the word "and"
- Class would be challenging for new team members to read and quickly
  "get it"
- Class has fields that are only used in some methods
- Class has static methods that only operate on parameters
